## Installation
 1. Install the free Tampermonkey extension [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)][[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)]
 2. Navigate to any page, preferably [studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org)
 3. Click on the tampermonkey icon, you may have to open the extensions menu on google chrome
 4. Click "Create a new script"
 5. Copy the code from [userScript.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikapower9080/cdo-plus/main/userScript.js) and replace everything in the current editor that popped up with what you copied.
 6. Save your script by press Control/Command + S or by pressing file > save in the menu
 7. Visit [studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org) and see if it worked! You'll know if a window on the side pops up when you press the right shift key.
 8. See the usage guide for more information on how to use the script.

 ## Usage

 On most studio.code.org pages, you'll be able to load the console by pressing the shift key on the right side of your keyboard (right shift). The settings are pretty self explanatory and save in between visits.

 ## Updating

 The script should automatically update, but if there were to be a loader update, you'd need to repeat steps 5-7 in the installation guide to update your loader script. The loader script is extremely simple and won't be updated often unless there is a critical bug fix.

 ## Contributing
